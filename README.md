# purescript-pselm-signals

This is a work-in-progress to provide a Purescript implementation of Elm 0.16's
signal-related modules.

For the Elm architecture as implemented in Elm 0.17 and 0.18, see
[purescript-pselm-core](https://github.com/pselm/core). That is also where I
have moved some descriptive text about differences between Elm and Purescript,
and the status of the project as a whole.
